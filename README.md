# LeetCode-Swift-Solutions
Answers to LeetCode questions in Swift 3

Started primarily for a few reasons:

- First and foremost, Swift is really cool and fun to use!
- I felt like I was becoming too complacent with Python for interviews, work, projects, etc.
- Similarly, Python provides shortcuts that might hurt algorithmic thought processes.
- Swift is new to LeetCode (as of early/mid 2017), so even if I want to cheat, all I can get is the ideas and not the source code.

Hope to keep this as a running repository as I continue to work on algorithms, feel free to PR with your own solutions if you'd like!

Currently included:

- [1. Two Sum](https://github.com/StevenSawtelle/LeetCode-Swift-Solutions/blob/master/twoSum.swift)
- [2. Add Two Numbers](https://github.com/StevenSawtelle/LeetCode-Swift-Solutions/blob/master/addTwo.swift)
- [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\*](https://github.com/StevenSawtelle/LeetCode-Swift-Solutions/blob/master/longestSubstring.swift)


* This one feels especially dirty with the need to encode Strings as Arrays of UTF-8 bits to iterate efficiently. If anyone has ideas for handling this better, please fork it! Stack Overflow and the LeetCode forums can only help so much ðŸ˜‰
